  <h3>  Logical Reasoning</h3>
    <p><strong>Q. 93.</strong>A package is never accepted for delivery by the delivery service unless it is within the established size limits. All packages accepted for delivery by the delivery have a return address.</p>
    <p>If the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true?</p>
        <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">	The delivery service charges more for heavier packages than for lighter packages. </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">	The delivery service will always accept for delivery a package that is within the established size limits</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">If a package is within the established size limits and has a return address, it will be accepted for delivery by the delivery service no matter how heavy the package is.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">A package that is not within the established size limits but has a return address is never accepted for delivery by the delivery service.</span></li>
          <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">The delivery service does not charge for packages that must be returned to the sender.</span></li>

    <p><strong>Q. 94.</strong>The pattern of scientific grants awarded by foundations is changing as the number of worthy requests grows in the face of cuts in federal spending. Many foundations, formerly willing to fund innovative but risky projects, have begun to support relatively conservative projects only.</p>
<p>From the passage above it can be most reasonably concluded that which of the following was true when the passage was written as compared to preceding year?</p>
        <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">	Foundations were being forced to recognize that they could be more effective by granting smaller amount of money to a greater number of projects.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">		The decision – makers at foundations tended to be more politically conservative.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">Foundations had less money available to support worthwhile projects because of the rising costs of other activities.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">Foundations were increasingly allowing decisions about which projects to fund to be based on a reluctance t see projects they supported fail.</span></li>
          <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">Those programs that were more innovative than the ones funded by foundations were supported by the limited federal funds that were still available.</span></li>

    <p><strong>Q. 95.</strong>The wheat Farmers Alliance, a political action committee attracts 70 percent of its contributors from an advertisement requesting contributions placed only in the September, October, and November issues of the Grange Report, a monthly newsletter for wheat farmers. The president of the Wheat Farmers Alliance, to increase the number of contributors, decides to increase the number of contributors decides to advertise in each of the monthly issues of the Grange Report. She expects that as result of the additional Grange Report advertisements the number of contributors will be increased to at least double the present number.</p>
<p>Which of the following if true would most strongly support the president’s exception?</p>
        <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">	The September, October, and November advertisements were noticed by fewer than one- third of those readers of the Grange Report who would be willing to contribute to the Wheat Farmers Alliance.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">	Wheat farmers traditionally repay their bank loans in late summer after the winter wheat crop has been harvested and sold.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">The majority of the readers of the Grange Report with a great enough interest in the Wheat Farmers Alliance to contribute have already responded to the advertisements.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">Most of those who contribute to the Wheat Farmers Alliance in the course of a year do so in response to advertisements in the Grange Report.</span></li>
          <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">The total number of readers of the Grange Report is stable from year to year.</span></li>

    <p><strong>Q. 96.</strong>Plants that exhibit certain leaf diseases tend to measure extremely high in the amount of zinc in their leaf and stem tissue. Botanists have discovered that phosphorus of the type typically used in a phosphorus-high fertilizer reacts with the zinc in such a way as to prevent treated plants from exhibiting the leaf diseases. Thus, plants can be cured from these leaf diseases by the use of a fertilizer high in phosphorus. The passage’s conclusion is based upon which one of the following premises?</p>
<p>Which of the following if true would most strongly support the president’s exception?</p>
        <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">Plants with certain leaf diseases contain the same high level of zinc in their leaf and stem tissue.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">Zinc is the cause and not merely an effect of the leaf diseases.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">Treating the plants with a fertilizer high in phosphorus will have no negative effect on the plants.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">The amount of phosphorus-high fertilizer which should be used depends upon the size and location of the plants.</span></li>
          <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">Normal plant tissue does not contain zinc.</span></li>

        <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">Chase’s brother, who has also petitioned for membership at Brown, has a net worth of 10 billion dollars and considers it beneath his dignity to associate with anyone in the entertainment industry. Hence, his petition will be accepted.</span></li>
          <li><span style="font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px">Chase has not financed any Hollywood movies.</span></li>
